GAN-Based Portrait Image Generation with TensorFlow/Keras

Built and trained a custom Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) pipeline to synthesize portrait-style images: dataset ingestion, normalization, generator/discriminator architecture design, custom training loop (Keras subclassing), and qualitative evaluation through generated samples. 

Completed as part of a group project.
